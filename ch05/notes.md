# Blackbox

## Functions

- Package up an `algorithm` for later use
- functions are variables for algorithms
  - variables store data
  - functions store algorithms


# Single Responsibility principle

- Do one thing well

# Scope

- Global Scope: anything not in a function (or class)
- Parameters pass values as arguments, not names

- Arguments names are the same variables

- Shadowing
  - When you assign to a local variable of the same name as another variable in a higher scope, it make the higher scoped variable inaccessible


## None

- type: NoneType
- val: None


# return

- Functions only return one thing

# Chapter 1: Data

- Algorithms: doesn't change
- Data: data will change

> RULE #1: Separate things that change from things that stay the same

## print() function

- any number arguments

```py
print('a', 'b', 'c')
```

- separated by spaces

```py
print('a', 'b', 'c', sep=",")
```

## Functions

- A function takes input and gives a result
- f(x) = y

In python, functions always are followed by parenthesis

`print()`

Data == Object

Objects have types
value type
"a" = 97 str
97 = 97 int

# static typed

# loose typed - duck typed

The type of data defines the behavior of the data

# DRY Rule

Don't Repeat Yourself

## Variables

`name = value`

variable names have some rules:

- all lower case, spaces are represented by \_
  - my_variable #snake case
  - myVariable # camel case
- Reserved words:
  - True, False, class, for..

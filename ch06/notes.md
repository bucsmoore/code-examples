- Files are saved program state
- Allowing anyone to access files is dangerous
- OS manages file access

- Files are one way STREAMS
  - reading: `open(myfile)`, `open(myfile, 'r')`
    - opens the file, provides access to its contents
  - writing: `open(myfile, 'w')`
    - if no file exist, create it
    - if file exists, delete, and recreate a blank file
  - appending: `open(myfile, 'a')`
    - if no file exist, create it
    - if file exists, append data to the end of the file

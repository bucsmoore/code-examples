# Selection

Boolean expression to select and algorithm

```py
if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION: #colon
    True algorithm #code block, indented
else: #optional
    False algorithm #code block, indented
```

# elif

chained condition - only runs if previous conditions are not met


- `if` condition: only one, goes first, requires a boolean expression, required
- `elif` condition: always comes after if, can have as many as you need, requires a boolean expression, optional
- `else`: always goes last, is optional, has no boolean expression
